## Schemas
There is no JSON schemas provided; that a quick Google search could find, that we can check our responses against so we are inferring types and possible values from the examples given on the (https://opsgenie.status.atlassian.com/api/v2) page.

Where there is no concreate type given we will fall back to a basic `string` to cover all possible inputs.
